# Party Stock

## What is the Bierbörse?

The **Bierbörse** is a popular event concept originating from Germany, often referred to as a "beer market" or "beer stock exchange." The idea is to turn beer-drinking into an exciting and dynamic experience inspired by the principles of a stock market. Here's how it works:

- Beers are treated like stock market items, and their prices fluctuate in real-time based on demand.
- If a certain beer is ordered a lot during a period, its price goes up, much like a stock that’s heavily traded.
- Meanwhile, less popular beers drop in price as demand for them decreases.

The concept is heavily tied to the social and lively drinking culture of Germany, making each event unique and engaging. Many venues across Germany organize Bierbörse-themed nights, turning regular bars or beer events into something akin to a fun trading floor—but instead of stocks, you trade beer preferences!

## About This Project

The **party_stock** project is a small, fun initiative inspired by the dynamics of the Bierbörse! The goal is to bring the excitement of fluctuating beer prices and event planning to life—whether for parties, celebrations, or just casual gatherings.

Ideas for where this could go:
- A system where drink prices fluctuate based on the preferences of party guests.
- Visual indicators for "hot" or "cold" drinks as demand shifts.
- Gamifying party drinking experiences with a stock market theme.
